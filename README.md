# BOCCHI

**Better Occult Crescent & Chest Helper Interface**

A Dalamud plugin for Occult Crescent (South Horn / North Horn). It helps you see what’s up, get there, open coffers, and — if you want — run the zone on autopilot.

## What it can do

### World overview
- Live **FATE** and **Critical Encounter** lists with rewards
- **Path** (aethernet + walk) or **Teleport** (aethernet hop only) to an activity
- Flag activities on the map

### Illegal Mode (full autopilot)
- Pick and travel to FATEs and/or Critical Encounters
- Prefer / wait for **Magic Pot** FATEs and farm **pot chests** (Magical Elixir + compass hints)
- Optional **BOCCHI AI** (BossMod / BMR autorotation preset for targeting, movement, and job rotation — not legacy `ai:on`)
- Auto-mount, Return to camp, repair, Treasure Sight at camp
- Optional auto treasure hunt between activities
- Phantom job leveling helper

### Pots & Treasure
- Dedicated loop: pot windows ↔ treasure hunting without full Illegal Mode

### Treasure Hunter
- Planned coffer routes (bronze / silver) with aethernet-aware pathing
- Treasure Sight during the hunt; pause / resume / recalculate
- Radar lines to nearby coffers and carrots
- **Carrot Hunt:** authored map tour with nearest-next routing and aethernet hops; Fortune Carrot → bunny gold chest

### Mob Farmer
- Pull and clear selected mob packs in a farm area (separate from Illegal Mode)

### Buffs
- Apply knowledge-crystal style buffs (Apply / Stop from the main window)

### Trackers
- Experience / gold / silver per hour style session stats

### Languages
- English, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese
